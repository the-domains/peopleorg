            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Conversations and narratives are the new documents - What's The Future of Work?</h1><p>With the emergence of writing, physical presence was no longer necessary for sharing information. In other words, a person's being there was not necessary for their influence to be felt. As typing replaced handwriting or when movable type replaced the hand copying of words, it became even easier to communicate with words that replicated ideas and simulated human interaction without face-to-face contact.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/55a599236cc70e8d922a35de2b145b6d/noop.jpeg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-images-1.medium.com%2Fmax%2F1200%2F1*6-QAnO0CWijaZqYlnjSWfg.jpeg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Digital globalization: The new era of global flows</h1><p>Soaring flows of data and information now generate more economic value than the global goods trade. Conventional wisdom says that globalization has stalled. But although the global goods trade has flattened and cross-border capital flows have declined sharply since 2008, globalization is not heading into reverse.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/588138250f32720a3873c354b8e8b993/noop.ashx?input=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mckinsey.com%2F~%2Fmedia%2FMcKinsey%2FBusiness%2520Functions%2FMcKinsey%2520Digital%2FOur%2520Insights%2FDigital%2520globalization%2520The%2520new%2520era%2520of%2520global%2520flows%2FMGIGlobalFlows1536x1536_Standard_Standard.ashx"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Crowdsourcing - The way of the future?</h1><p>Will R&D departments be replaced by crowdsourcing? Or at least partly? A problem solved is a problem halved, the old saying goes. But what happens when you share a problem with an abundance of people instead of just a few colleagues? Research and development is usually regarded as top secret and fiercely guarded against prying eyes.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/dc60e5ed1b9f800fb2e3b660d032cc58/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcatarinasworld.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F08%2Fcrowdsourcing-640x440.jpg"></article>]]></description>

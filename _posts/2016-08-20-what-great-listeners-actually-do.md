  Deep listening require the motivation to truly understand without judging
  who’s right or wrong. Understanding what is of essence require reflection, or
  deep thinking. Connecting the dots require conversation and more deep
  listening. It’s not how much you talk that count rather what you say that
  matters. Always listen deeply, where your heart lies. That’s where you
  encounter the essence of what matters and create meaning. #JF

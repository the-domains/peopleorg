      Many professionals think they are pretty good at managing their internal
      communications. Maybe you have a system of color-coded, prioritized
      folders in your email inbox, of which you're particularly proud. Or you're
      that senior leader who makes a point to get coffee with your direct
      reports individually once a month, so you're confident that everyone on
      your team is in the loop.

  With the emergence of writing, physical presence was no longer necessary for
  sharing information. In other words, a person's being there was not necessary
  for their influence to be felt. As typing replaced handwriting or when movable
  type replaced the hand copying of words, it became even easier to communicate
  with words that replicated ideas and simulated human interaction without
  face-to-face contact.
